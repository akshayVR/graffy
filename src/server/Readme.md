# Graffy Server

Node.js library for building an API for a Graffy store.

This creates an HTTP request handler for serving an API that is compatible with Graffy Client. The request handler can be used with the Node.js built-in http, https and http2 `createServer()` and with Express.js.

See [Graffy documentation](https://graffy.org#/GraffyServer) for more.
